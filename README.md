# Simple Dryer Signal
I have a cheap dryer, it has no "done" signal.  I'm adding one using a current sensor and an ATTiny85

[DryerSignal](DryerSignal) contains the code for the ATTiny85.  I used [Eclipse with an Arduino plugin](http://sloeber.io) for development.  If you want to use the Arduino IDE then create an empty file named DryerSignal.ino

[eagle](eagle) contains the [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) design files.

Its a work in progress....
